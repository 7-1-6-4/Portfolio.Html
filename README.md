This is my personal website detailing my life story and ambitions.
I purchased the domain name crissystech.com from Namecheap, selecting it because it aligns perfectly with my brand. After confirming its availability, I registered the domain and added WHOIS privacy protection to keep my personal information secure. Next, I chose Bluehost for hosting due to its reliable performance and user-friendly interface. I connected the domain to the hosting service by updating the DNS nameservers provided by Bluehost and then uploaded the website files using cPanel.

To ensure security, I installed a free SSL certificate from Letâ€™s Encrypt to enable HTTPS and encrypted all sensitive data stored in the database with AES-256. I set up a firewall and DDoS protection using Cloudflare to safeguard the site from attacks. Additionally, I implemented strong password policies, enabled two-factor authentication for administrator accounts, and scheduled regular backups to prevent data loss. Monitoring tools like Sucuri were deployed to detect vulnerabilities and threats, ensuring the website remains secure and trustworthy.
